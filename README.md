# TetbowCodes
These are the codes used for analysis in the paper "Bright multi-color labeling of neuronal circuits with fluorescent proteins and chemical tags" by Sakaguchi et al 2018

To use them you will need MATLAB and excel
For modelling data use the following codes
1) mnl_GeneratePoissonRGBvals
2) EvaluateModelDistances
For Tetbow Concentration analysis use the following codes
1) mnl_ImportColourData (NB from excel spreadsheet, and do for all groups)
2) mnl_CreateTetbowStructures
3) TetbowConcentrationEvaluationAnalysis
For Comparing axons use the following
1) mnl_TernaryAxons
For our human Colour Detection use the following
1) EvaluateColourDiscrimination 
or
1) EvaluationOnly (if you've already created your colour sets - recommended as it will take some time to generate a
